# StealthDebug
Hide USB-Debugging properties

I developed it for the game Fortnite Mobile and it works fine. But be aware that this will not intercept any function calls which retrieve global states of the status.
So you need a good pairing with an LSPosed module like https://github.com/Xposed-Modules-Repo/xyz.xfqlittlefan.notdeveloper

Prerequisite: Rooted device with Xposed/LSPosed installed.

Open the Magisk app

Go to the Modules section

Tap “Install from storage” and select StealthDebug.zip

Reboot the device

After reboot, the module will start automatically in the background.
